There are 11 COBOL programs that I created by working through the relevant videos that form a file programming project  from a YouTube playlist that I found at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlTr7U0S0wdEVeZOHshsbGItV2KlCdNWQ.

I used the following videos from the playlist:
  1) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKNyKOTbcrc

  3) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZAD4FezSMM

  10) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mRMtR_uUpw

I was not able to find videos for some of the later parts of the file programming project, so I made my own payment file and created the remaining COBOL programs using that file to complete the file programming project.
