# My Mainframe Journey
This repository was used for my journey into learning about the world of mainframe computers.

I planned to work on the following five Udemy courses in order to gain a better understanding of working with mainframe computers:
  1. [Mainframe COBOL Developer Training By Anil Polsani](https://www.udemy.com/course/cobol-by-anilpolsani/) \([Completed](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-dbb842f1-bb16-4284-a80d-d4bdb76fd7d5/))
  2. [Mainframe JCL Developer-Support Training By Anil Polsani](https://www.udemy.com/course/mainframe-jcl-developer-support-training-by-anil-polsani/) \([Completed](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-947b566a-748e-4ef8-8468-0b0027f0c937/))
  3. [Mainframe DB2 Developer Training By Anil Polsani](https://www.udemy.com/course/mainframe-db2-developer-training-by-anil-polsani/) \([Completed](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-408b5b16-e1aa-4d30-a6ec-79fbfb2f271a/))
  4. [Mainframe CICS Developer Training By Anil Polsani](https://www.udemy.com/course/mainframe-cics-developer-training-by-anil-polsani/)
  5. [Mainframe IMS-DB For Beginners - Training By Anil Polsani](https://www.udemy.com/course/mainframe-ims-db-by-anil-polsani/)

My goal was not to finish all the courses. I had a list of courses to work on so that I would have some direction to focus my time and energy on.

NOTE: I have earned [the IBM Z Xplore - Concepts badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/54b96efb-eb89-47dc-9f9b-636461fa0da1/public_url). 

## Goal
I wanted to learn or do something new every day related to mainframes and write about it. I strived to be curious, consistent, and persistent during this journey.


## Timeline
I started this journey on February 26, 2024, and ended it on May 2, 2024. I originally intended it to end on May 12, 2024, but that was just a date that I threw out there so that I could push myself to stick with mainframes for at least two months. I accomplished my goal, and I like what I have accomplished during this journey.
