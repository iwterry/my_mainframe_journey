# My Mainframe Journey
This repository will be used for my journey into learning about the world of mainframe computers.

I plan to work on the following five Udemy courses in order to gain a better understanding of working with mainframe computers:
  1. [Mainframe COBOL Developer Training By Anil Polsani](https://www.udemy.com/course/cobol-by-anilpolsani/) \([Completed](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-dbb842f1-bb16-4284-a80d-d4bdb76fd7d5/))
  2. [Mainframe JCL Developer-Support Training By Anil Polsani](https://www.udemy.com/course/mainframe-jcl-developer-support-training-by-anil-polsani/)
  3. [Mainframe DB2 Developer Training By Anil Polsani](https://www.udemy.com/course/mainframe-db2-developer-training-by-anil-polsani/)
  4. [Mainframe CICS Developer Training By Anil Polsani](https://www.udemy.com/course/mainframe-cics-developer-training-by-anil-polsani/)
  5. [Mainframe IMS-DB For Beginners - Training By Anil Polsani](https://www.udemy.com/course/mainframe-ims-db-by-anil-polsani/)

I am not expecting myself to complete all the courses. That is not the goal. These courses will be my main learning resources to help me maintain focus and provide some direction for my learning.

NOTE: I have earned [the IBM Z Xplore - Concepts badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/54b96efb-eb89-47dc-9f9b-636461fa0da1/public_url). 

## Goal
I want to learn something new every day in regards to mainframes and write about some things that I learn. My writings may not be accurate, but that is fine. Life is about making mistakes and learning from them. I want to focus on learning daily and striving to be curious and passionate in regards to learning more about mainframes.


## Timeline
I plan to carry out this journey from February 26, 2024, to May 12, 2024. However, the timeline can be changed. Setting a time period of at least two months will help me be persistent and determined to stick with learning about mainframes.
