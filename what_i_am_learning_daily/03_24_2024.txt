I watched lecture 18 ("Redefines and Matching Logic") from the first course.
I watched the first half of lecture 19 ("Occurs Variable Declaration") from the first course.


In lecture 18, I learned about the following:
	- using REDEFINES clause and the FILLER keyword
	- using level number 66 with the RENAMES clause
	- using matching logic in a COBOL program that takes two input files

In the first half of lecture 19, I learned about using the OCCURS clause.
