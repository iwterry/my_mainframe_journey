I did a little playing around with COBOL.

I wrote my first comment line and my first in-line comment. I can do a comment by placing an asterick in column 7 of a COBOL program, and I can do an inline comment by placing an asterick immediately followed by the greater-than sign.

I thought that the following command inside an IF statement would result in a syntax error, but it did not:
  IF SOME-ALPHA-NUM-VAR = 'HELLO'
    DISPLAY 'HELLO '
      'WORLD'
  END-IF.

Things worked fine by doing it that way. I am assuming that the alpha-numeric variable SOME-ALPHA-NUM-VAR exists.

I thought that writing "DISPLAY 'HELLO' DISPLAY 'HELLO'" in COBOL would result in a syntax error, but it did not. 

I am getting more comfortable with (and gaining a better understanding of) COBOL syntax by experimenting around.

Today was more of a rest day, but I just wanted to challenge myself every day to learn or do something new regarding things related to mainframes.
