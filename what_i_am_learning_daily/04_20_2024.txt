I watched the 7th lecture ("COBOL-DB2 Select - Cursor Concept") from the third course.

I learned about the SELECT statement and how to retrieve only one row even if there are multiple rows that match the query.

I learned the following about cursors:
	- how to declare them in a COBOL program
	- some of the different types of cursors
		- scrollable and non-scrollable cursors
		- dynamic and static cursors
	- how to open them in a COBOL program
	- how to fetch a row from them in a COBOL program
	- how to close them in a COBOL program
