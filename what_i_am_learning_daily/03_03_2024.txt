I reviewed lecture 5 of the first course.

I am able to gain a better understanding of the process of compiling and executing a COBOL program from the demonstrations in the lecture.

JCL jobs can be used to both compile a COBOL program and execute the load module. JCL jobs can be ran (or submitted) by using the "SUBMIT" command that can be typed in the area for commands when you are viewing the file for the JCL job. Once the JCL job has been submitted, an acknowledgement message in red color can be seen that contains the job name and an autogenerated job sequence number. Once the job finishes execution, a job completion notification message in red color can be seen that contains something called "MAXCC":
	- If MAXCC=0, the job finished successfully.
	- If MAXCC=4, the job finished successfully with a warning (which could be safely ignored).
	- If MAXCC > 4 (such as MAXCC=8 or MAXCC=12), then there is an error.

I am better able to understand how the output of a COBOL program can be viewed after the COBOL program has finished execution. The output can be stored temporarily in a spool and viewed by navigating through the ISPF PRIMARY OPTION MENU.

While I did view lecture 5 yesterday, I did not pay as much attention to the details discussed above because I faced issues with how to compile COBOL programs using JCL. I am using a different setup from the one that the course instructor is using, so I am not able to follow all of the steps in the lecture. While I am not able to compile and execute my COBOL programs, I do have a better understanding of the overall process.
