I watched all but the last 15 minutes of the second half of lecture 14 ("FILE Concepts Theory") from the first course.
I watched 46 minutes of lecture 15 ("FILE Concepts Part-2") from the first course.


From the second half of lecture 14, I saw how to do the following in COBOL:
	- open files for either reading or writing
	- read one or all records from a file
	- write a record to a file
	- close files

For lecture 15, I saw how the INITIALIZE statement in COBOL can make it easier to initialize group variables. I watched the instructor code a program that accepts data from JCL and outputs data to a file. I typed along in Notepad to get myself used to writing the lines of code and to help myself digest the material.
