I watched the first lecture (Introduction to Mainframe) from the first course.

Three important things that I learned:
	- A mainframe is a computer that is used for storing and processing large amounts of data
	- Some of the following domains make use of mainframes:
		- banking
		- insurance
		- transport (like airlines)
		- stock market
		- retail
	- Batch processing and online processing are the two ways to process data in the mainframe:
		- batch processing
			- processes data in bulk
			- occurs on specified schedule
			- occurs without human interaction
		- An example of batch processing is a credit card company generating monthly billing statements for its customers on February 26, 2024.
		- online processing
			- occurs unscheduled
			- occurs as a result of human interaction (because a transaction occurred)
		- An example of an online processing is making a person using their debit card to withdraw money from an automated teller machine (ATM).
