I watched lecture 5 ("Introduction to ZOS-TSO-ISPF Practical") from the first course.

I had my first hands-on experience using mainframes by taking advantage of IBM Z software trials in order to get free access to a mainframe. On that mainframe, I created a couple of PDS data sets and wrote a couple of really simple COBOL programs.
