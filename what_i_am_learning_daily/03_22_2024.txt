I again focused only on hands-on practice with an IBM mainframe. I gained hands-on experience with developing COBOL programs that read from and write to files and that made use of copybooks for reusability of code. 

It took me some time to figure out how things work when using files with COBOL programs. Many times, my program abnormally terminated, and I could not figure out why. There were many new things I was learning, so I was not sure where my mistake was.

I thought I did not have permission to use the mainframe to create PS data sets using COBOL. When I looked at the logs for JCL, I could see that my data set was being created. I placed some print statements in my code and used them to determine what line in the code was causing the issue. I found the line and changed where I put the line, and things worked.

I learned that group variables in the FILE SECTION (of the DATA DIVISION) should be initialized using the INITIALIZE statement after the file has been opened. My mistake was that I was doing it before I opened the files. The Udemy instructor waited to initialize the file group variables until after the files were opened, but I did not know why. Now, I have experienced why.

Today (just like the past couple of days) was filled with a lot of googling and looking through logs in order to find problems and provide solutions.
