I watched the 11th lecture ("COBOL-DB Update Mainpgm - Subpgm Update") from the third course.
I watched the 12th lecture ("COBOL-DB Update Restart Logic Programs") from the third course.
I watched the 13th lecture ("COBOL-DB Load and Unload Concept") from the third course.


I practiced creating a COBOL main program and a subprogram that both made use of DB2 so that the main program could update rows using a cursor.

The screenshots for the work that I did can be seen at https://github.com/iwterry/my_mainframe_journey/tree/main/mainframe_db2_developer_training/screenshots/04_24_2024.

I read through the provided COBOL code for the restart logic program to gain a better understanding of how it works.

I learned about the isolation levels of DB2, loading data into DB2 and unloading data from DB2, and tablespace locking used for loading data into DB2.
