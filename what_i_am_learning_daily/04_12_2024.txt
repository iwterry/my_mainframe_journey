I watched the 9th lecture ("JCL GDG Concept Part-2"), 10th lecture ("JCL Procedure - PROC Part-1"), and the 11th lecture ("JCL Procedure - PROC Overriding Part-2") from the second course.

Some of the things that I learned about today are the following:
	- reading from and writing to a GDG generation
	- creating and using instream and catalog JCL procedures
	- creating and using symbolic parameters
	- using symbolic parameter overriding, DDNAME overriding, and parameter overriding
