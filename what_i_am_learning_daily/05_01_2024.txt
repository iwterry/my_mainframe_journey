I finished watching the 5th lecture ("How to Code COBOL-CICS Program Part-2") from the fourth course.

I learned about when to use the different syntaxes of the RETURN command.

I learned about two ways that a COBOL-CICS program can be triggered (or executed to run).

I learned how the EIBCALEN variable can be used in the program to know if the program has been triggered previously or not.

I learned how the EIBAID variable can be used to determine which key is pressed by the user.
