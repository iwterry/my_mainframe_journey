I continued hands-on practice with COBOL.

I learned how to work with dates in COBOL by using the following instrinsic functions: 
	- CURRENT-DATE
	- INTEGER-OF-DATE
	- DATE-OF-INTEGER

With the help of these functions, I was able to do the following:
	- get the current date
	- calculate the number of days between two dates
	- calculate a new date by adding (or subtracting) a number of days to (or from) a given date

I practiced the INSPECT statement with the REPLACE syntax to replace some characters in a string.

I practiced finding the number of characters in a string (without including the number of trailing spaces at the end of the string). I successfully recalled the solution that was shown in lecture 22 of the first Udemy course.

I am now working on file processing that involves matching logic and lookup logic so that I can get a better understanding of these two.

I started working on the matching logic, but I have to debug my program to fix some issues that I am having.
