I watched the 1st lecture ("Introduction to Mainframe DB2") and the 2nd lecture ("Mainframe DB2 Understanding DB2 Table and Constraints") from the third course.

I learned about the following DB2 data types (along with the corresponding COBOL data type to use in a COBOL program):
	- CHAR
	- VARCHAR
	- SMALLINT
	- INT
	- DECIMAL
	- DATE
	- TIME
	- TIMESTAMP

I learned about the following DB2 constraints:
	- NOT NULL
	- WITH DEFAULT
	- UNIQUE
	- PRIMARY KEY
	- FOREIGN KEY

I learned about each data type's default value for the data types mentioned earlier.

I learned about parent-child relationships in DB2, ON DELETE CASCADE, and ON DELETE RESTRICT.
