I watched the 6th lecture ("JCL Parameters - DD Statement") from the second course.

I gained a deeper understanding of the DISP and DSN parameters for the DD statement in JCL by following what the course instructor was doing and experimentating on my own.

Some of the things that I did today are the following:
	- I created temporary PS datasets using different approaches and appended records to an existing PS dataset. 
	- Using the ISPF text editor, I searched for specific text in a file and learned how to go to the next or previous matches of the text.
	- I created more IF statements in JCL to practice having better control over whether particular job steps are executed.

I feel more comfortable looking at the JESYSMSG, JESJCL, and JESMSGLG files to detect issues in my JCL and see what is happening.
