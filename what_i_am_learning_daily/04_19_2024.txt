I watched the 6th lecture ("COBOL-DB2 Insert Program") from the third course.

I spent a lot of time working through the lecture and challenging myself to come up with my own solutions for the different scenarios discussed.

The things that I have done today can be seen at https://github.com/iwterry/my_mainframe_journey/mainframe_db2_developer_training/screenshots/04_19_2024/.
