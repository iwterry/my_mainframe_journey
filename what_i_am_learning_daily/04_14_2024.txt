I practiced with JCL and JCL utilities on a mainframe.

I used the options from the ISPF Primary Option Menu to do the following:
	- copy a partitioned data set, a member of a partitioned data set, and a sequential data set 
	- create a generation data group (GDG) base
	- compare two sequential data sets to see what insertion and deletion changes were made between them
	- compare two members of different partitioned data sets to see what insertion and deletion changes were made between them

I used the SORT utility to do the following things:
	- copy a sequential data set
	- concatenate multiple sequential data sets together
	- sort a sequential data set
	- remove records so that a field has no duplicate values
	- perform aggregation of a field's values based on the values of a different field 

I practiced creating and using JCL procedures and symbolic parameters. 
I used symbolic overriding to change the primary quantity space, secondary quantity space, and generation number for GDG
I used DDNAME overriding to change which data set was being used or created.
I used parameter overriding to change the value of the COND parameter on an EXEC statement.
