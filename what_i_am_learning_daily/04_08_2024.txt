I watched the 4th lecture ("JCL Parameters - JOB Statement") from the second course.

I learned about the JCL parameters for the JOB statement.

The first positional parameter provides account information, which is done for billing purposes.

The second positional parameter provides the programmer's (or group's) name for the job.

The following are the keyword parameters for the JOB statement that I learned about:
	- NOTIFY
	- CLASS
 	- TIME
	- REGION
	- PRTY
	- MSGCLASS
	- MSGLEVEL
	- RESTART

The positional parameters must come before the keyword parameters.
