I watched both the 7th lecture ("JCL Utilities - Overview") and the 8th lecture ("JCL Utilties Continued - GDG Base Part-1") from the second course.

I learned about the following JCL utilities:
	- IEFBR14
	- IEBGENER
	- IEBCOPY
	- IEBCOMPR
	- IDCAMS

I also learned how to create GDG (generation data group).
