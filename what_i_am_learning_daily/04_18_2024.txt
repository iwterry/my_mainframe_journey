I spent my time trying to figure out how to compile and execute a COBOL program that uses DB2. I got it to work after a lot of trial and error. The program inserts a record into the database, and the data that goes into the database is hard-coded in the program. I just wanted to keep things simple.

My only intention today was to make sure that I was able to work with COBOL and DB2 together. I did a lot of Google searching and looked at YouTube videos to figure out how I could compile and execute the program on the mainframe I was using. I was able to find some resources and adjust them to work with the mainframe I was using.

I was not sure if I was going to be able to do it, but I kept pushing forward and learning along the way. This challenge allowed me to get a better understanding of what is involved in compiling and executing a COBOL program that uses DB2.
