I used COBOL to gain my first hands-on practice with the following:
	- reference modification (which allows me create substrings)
	- STRING statement     (which allows me to concatenate strings)
	- UNSTRING statement   (which allows me to split a string into multiple strings based on a delimiter)
	- INSPECT statement with the TALLYING syntax (which allows me to count the occurrences of characters in different circumstances)

I played around with concepts by coming up with simple examples to get a better understanding of how they work.
