I watched the 3rd lecture ("CICS Screen Design Using BMS Macros") from the fourth course.

I learned about the following:
	- DFHMDI properties
		- SIZE
		- LINE
		- COLUMN
		- CTRL
	- DFHMDF properties
		- POS
		- INITIAL
		- Protection (protected/unprotected)
		- NUM
		- IC
		- Visibility (normal/dark/bright)
			

I also learned CTRL cannot be used for both the map and the mapset.
