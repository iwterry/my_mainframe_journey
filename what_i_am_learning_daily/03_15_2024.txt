I watched the first half of lecture 14 ("FILE Concepts Theory") from the first course.

I learned about some things to include in the FILE-CONTROL paragraph of the ENVIRONMENT DIVISION and the FILE SECTION and WORKING-STORAGE SECTION of the DATA DIVISION of a COBOL program when dealing with files.

I learned about the following:
	- the SELECT statement (and its usage in helping link a file between COBOL and JCL)
	- the different file organizations:
		- SEQUENTIAL
		- INDEXED
	- the different access modes:
		- SEQUENTIAL
		- RANDOM
		- DYNAMIC
	- the file status (in order to determine the success or failure of a file operation)

In the FILE-CONTROL paragraph of the ENVIRONMENT DIVISION, the following are provided for each data file:
	- SELECT statement
	- organization type
	- access mode
	- which variable to be used for file status

In the FILE SECTION of the DATA DIVISION, the file record layout is provided for each data file to provide field information about a record in a data file.

In the WORKING-STORAGE SECTION of the DATA DIVISION, a variable for each data file is defined that can hold the file status for a data file.
