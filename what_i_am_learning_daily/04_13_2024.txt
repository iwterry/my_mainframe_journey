I watched the 12th lecture ("JCL Production Abend Overview") and the 13th lecture ("JCL Sort Utility") from the second course.

The course instructor discussed the handling of different abend codes in production settings.

I learned that the JCL Sort utility can be used to sort records in a PS dataset, copy records in a PS dataset, and eliminate duplicate records from a PS dataset.

I practiced the with the following utilities on a mainframe today:
	- IEFBR14
		- to create a new PS dataset
		- to delete an existing PS dataset
	- IEBGENER
		- to copy a PS dataset
		- to concatenate multiple PS datasets
	- IDCAMS
		- to delete an existing PS dataset
		- to create a GDG base

I also practiced creating GDG generations and reading from GDG generations.
