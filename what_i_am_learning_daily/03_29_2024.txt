I continued working on what I was doing yesterday with practicing COBOL.

I created COBOL programs that made use of different features. The screenshots for the programs and copybooks can be seen at https://github.com/iwterry/my_mainframe_journey/tree/main/mainframe_cobol_developer_training/screenshots/03_29_2024.

Unfortunately, I encountered an issue with linking subprograms while compiling using JCL. I have not been able to resolve the issue. It has something to do with how the system is configured for the mainframe I was using with the IBM Z trials.Â 

I was able to practice the concept of using and calling subprograms with Visual Studio Code and the mainframe for the IBM Z Xplorer content. 

I practiced concepts related to the following:
	- copybooks (to improve reusability)
	- level number 88 (and data coding)
	- OCCURS statement
	- REDEFINES clause
	- IF statement
	- MOVE statement
	- reading to and writing from files
	- writing and calling subprograms
	- DISPLAY statement
	- ACCEPT statement
	- USAGE IS clause (to use the COMP-3 format for numeric data to improve data security and save memory)
	- PERFORM statement
		- PERFORM THRU syntax
		- PERFORM UNTIL syntax
		- PERFORM VARYING syntax
	- COMPUTE and ADD statements (for do mathematical operations)


I did a lot of looking through the logs to troubleshoot issues relating to syntax errors and logic mistakes.

I put in a lot of work and gained so much by making mistakes and learning from them with having to come up with something on my own to practice different concepts. I feel glad, but I also feel a bit disappointed that things did not work out with the IBM Z trial mainframe.
